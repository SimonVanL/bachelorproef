  abstract    = {The apparel industry has repeatedly faced the problem of the return of products due to the 
intangibility  factor. This  intangibility of  feel and touch of the product has  constantly been 
attributedto  the  trust  factor.  This  research  endeavor  tries  to  study  the  influence  of  online 
website cues such as Product presentation and Perceived interactivity) whether they have a 
decisive impact on the purchase intention of generation Z mediated by the trust factor. The 
paper examines trust as a mediating factor from the gaps of previous literature who fail to 
consider  trust  in  the  light  of  a  consumer  behavior  perspective,  as  trust  is  a  vital  factor 
under  the  given  conditions  of  risk  and  uncertainty.  Online  shopping  is  an  activity  which 
involves  primary  interaction  with  computers  and  customers,  which  acts  similar  to  the 
concept of having a salesman  in a  traditional  store that  influences  the purchase  intention. 
Therefore trust needs to acts as the salient salesman in the web world. In the current study, 
a web-based survey was administered to 2000 sample size equally distributed to male and 
female  respondents  who  fall  into  the  Generation  z  classification. Structural  equation 
modeling was performed to analyze the data. Results confirmed that all the necessary cues 
considered  for  the  study  from  extensive  review  have  a  substantial  impact  on  purchase 
intention  mediated  by  trust.  Therefore,  Marketers  and  decision  makers  of  the  online 
apparel website must cater to the contents of the website as these are important cues which 
influence the purchase intention of Generation Z},

An empirical study using food products demonstrates that packages displaying a picture of the most importance on these beliefs also had a better evaluation of the brand itself when its package included a product picture. This research thus provides that consumers use packaging, an extrinsic cue, to infer intrinsic product attributes. In addition, consumers reported a more positive attitude toward the package itself when it included a product picture.},

The present investigation extends prior research by examining how retailer cause fit affects consumer evaluations of retailers' cause related marketing strategies. The results indicate that the effects of retailer cause fit are moderated by consumer perceptions of the retailer's motive for engaging in cause related marketing, by the affinity that consumers hold for the social cause component of the campaign, as well as by the interactive effects associated with the two moderators.},

  abstract    = {Social network visual shopping trends are growing ecommerce at unprecedented levels. Images are used as product marketing material. however, image posts are triggering very low consumer behavior and low sales conversion. Objective. To explore how online stores can increase the purchasing prospects of their products using images on social networks. Methods. We introduce a theoretical probabilistic model to estimate consumer behavioral intention and purchasing prospect on social networks, outline parameters that can be exploited to increase click rate and conversion, and motivate a new strategy to market products online. The model explores increasing online stores' sales conversion by utilizing a product collection landing page that is marketed to consumers through a single Hook image. To implement the model, we developed a novel technological method that enabled online stores to post different Hook images on social networks and hyperlink them to the product collection landing pages they created. Results. Stores and marketers developed four types of Hook images: themed-collaged product images, single product images, lifestyle images, and model images. Themed collaged product images accounted for 60 percent of consumer traffic from social network sites. Moreover, consumer purchasing click rate increased at least twofold (4.94 percent) with the use of product collection landing pages.},

It provides a brief overview of efficiency evaluation research for ecommerce, and establishes a set of efficiency evaluation criteria, with the application of data envelopment analysis(DEA). The results suggest that ecommerce firms suffer from input congestion. Also, scale and technology issues, as well as low economic effectiveness, lead to the overall operational inefficiency. Business to business(B2B) ecommerce was more efficient and effectiveness in 2014, while online to offline(O2O) commerce had steadier and faster growth. In general, the performance of ecommerce firms is becoming better over time. The findings of this research can help managers to improvetheir firms' efficiency levels by resizing their operational scale, strengthening their technology infrastructure and applications, and improving their discretionary allocation of resources.},

  abstract    = {Purpose
In the competitive emarketplace today, sellers are using an increasing number of signals to entice customers to make online purchases. However, how differential these signals are in terms of their capacity to improve sales performance has not yet been investigated. The paper aims to discuss this issue.
Design/methodology/approach
Drawing on signaling theory and grounded in the context of China's largest emarketplace, Taobao, this study investigated the different effects of five commonly used signals on the sales performance of emarketplace sellers.
Findings
The authors find that warranty has the highest effect on sales performance, followed by overall rating, mean detailed seller rating, percent of positives, and web site quality.
Originality/value
First, this study builds on signaling theory and contributes to the emarketplace literature by providing new insights into how specific signals differentially affect sales performance in the emarketplace (with evidence from a large scale empirical analysis). Second, the study extends the applicability of signaling theory to the emarketplace domain by incorporating distinctive features of the emarketplace into the original signaling theory. Finally, the findings lend practical support to emarketplace sellers' investment decisions on signals and provide guidelines for deployment of such signals.},

  abstract    = {Purpose
Consumers as well as hotel web sites are evolving, changing the requirements and expectations for online hotel room reservations. Building on previous research, the purpose of this paper is to explore hotel web site design's influence on site appeal and likelihood to purchase.
Design/methodology/approach
The methodology incorporates both qualitative and quantitative methods. College age participants visited hotel web sites detailing their impressions. Using a grounded theory based approach and regression analysis, web design factors are identified and assessed.
Findings
The paper finds a preference for enhanced graphical web site design. This finding contradicts prior studies. The paper also finds continued importance in: ease of use, brand loyalty site content, and site aesthetics.
Research limitations/implications
This paper uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative data. The coding of qualitative data can be affected by researcher bias. This paper also suffers from an age and geographic population bias. While this paper suggests that certain factors
influence the likelihood to purchase, more extensive definition of these factors is needed. In addition, several factors, which were important in previous studies, have incongruous findings in this paper and need further examination.
Practical implications
The results give direction to the design of effective hotel web sites.
Originality/value
Rapidly evolving internet technologies and consumer behavior generate a need for ongoing research to consumer behavior. A study with valid insight and information completed previously may not accurately reflect today's internet hotel market. The findings are significant: they suggest there has been a shift in consumer preferences.},

Design/methodology/approach
This paper reviews research gathered over several years and it considers how significant increases in sales can be achieved by attention to shopper sightlines and movement through each retail space; how neuro imaging is starting to make sense of our reactions to products; how Virtual Reality can save money and how a well designed study is a cost effective means of ensuring environments are right for shoppers. The latest sensory approaches are also assessed together with thoughts to ponder for the next decade including a word of caution for all to ensure success does not come at the detriment of our planet.
Findings
The current economic gloom need not spell financial disaster for the retail sector. Consumers will simply become more discerning as they spend their limited resources. The savvy retailer will invest in understanding shopper needs and motivations to create an enhanced shopping experience by moving beyond simple POP displays and signage, where minor plus est, through to shoppers' sense of sound, sight, smell and touch which will have a clear impact on decisionmaking, store choice and spend.
